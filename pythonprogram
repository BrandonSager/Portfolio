# This is a program that adds, removes, or queries to a dictrionary of countries and their populations (in tens of millions).
# User will be asked if they want to add, remove, or query.
# If they select add or remove, they can enter a nations name and if it isn't already in the dictionary they will be asked to enter it's population.
# If they select query they will be asked for a country's name and they will see if it is in the dictionary and if it is, what the population is.
